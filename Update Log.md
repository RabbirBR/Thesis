## Things to know
The log will be in the order of newest to oldest.

### Done -
* Emailed the authors of [[1]](References.md).
* Created account with ESA to apply for Dataset.
* ESA SPACEWHALE program [Link to page](https://business.esa.int/projects/spacewhale).
    * The SPACEWHALE kick start project was launched in April 2018 and was successfully completed in December 2018. The SPACEWHALE algorithm accurately detected whales in satellite imagery independent of training images, thus proving the concept and technical feasibility. SPACEWHALE was able to achieve 100% accuracy on the identification of large whales in test imagery for this kick-start activity. The program can now be applied to new areas via a follow-up demonstration project.
    * Might be useful information for applying to Worldview-3 dataset.
    * Key Difference - The original paper studied specific species of whales and it was done using feature detection to detect key features of the whales, this program uses a Convolutional Neural Network to detect whales in general.
* Looked up the Sentinel Satellites and Copernicus Program. [Link to Copernicus program Overview](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Overview4).
    * <b>Sentinel-2</b> and <b>Sentinel-6</b> programs might be relevant to the thesis as they are both focused on oceanography, among other things.
* Looked for open data for images of whales from overhead (Aircraft/Ships/Satellite).
    * [[2]](References.md) Found a dataset collected and organized by NOAA. This tracks mammals around the Ocean near Alaska using aeroplane and ships. A list of known locations may help narrow the search of starting points when we have the image data. [Link to the Dataset](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/marine-mammal-observations-collected-by-aircraft-and-ship-and-submitted-as-part-of-the-conocoph89110).
        * Unfortunately, the dataset is old (2006-2010), they only give locations of mammals in general and does not mention exactly which animal was located in any given entry (Could also be a Walrus sighting, saw mentioned in one comment in the data). The dataset contains only some csv and xml files and no photos. Trying to find similar, more specific and more recent datasets.
* Found a paper studying whale behaviour in different situations using drones. (Ex: While traveling, while they are near other whales, etc.) [Link to paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2018.00319/full).


### Challenges -
* First author, Hannah C. Cubaynes, in paper [[1]](References.md) is away on vacation until 22nd January. Also mailed co-authors, waiting for reply.
* There are many things in the form for applying for the Worldview-3 dataset. Might be best to apply with guidance of the supervisor.

### Next Steps -
* Studying the datasets found.
* Studying more published papers before meeting in 16th January.
